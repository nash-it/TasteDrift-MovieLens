    "#Taste Drift in Movie Preferences: A Behavioral Clustering Project\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explores how user preferences for movie genres change over time using the [MovieLens 1M dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/1m/). We simulate a taste evolution model — inspired by how music apps like Spotify might track changes in musical mood — by building an ML pipeline that clusters users based on how their genre preferences shift over time.\n",

    "> Analyze behavioral drift in entertainment taste by:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Tracking how individual movie genre preferences change from early to late periods\n",
    "> * Grouping users with similar behavioral changes using unsupervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "🔍 **Note:** This project began as a proxy for modeling music taste drift. While music taste depends on deeper audio features, lyrics, and emotion — this implementation uses movie genres as a stand-in to simulate the same core concept: **temporal evolution of user preference.**\n",

    "1 Notebook 1: Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "* Loaded MovieLens ratings and movie metadata\n",
    "* Parsed timestamps, merged genre info\n",
    "* Explored trends in user activity, genres, and rating timelines\n",
    "\n",
    "2 Notebook 2: Feature Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Split each user’s timeline into **early** and **late** buckets\n",
    "* Built user × genre taste vectors (early vs. late preferences)\n",
    "* Saved normalized vectors to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "3 Notebook 3: Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "* Applied **StandardScaler** + **UMAP** for dimensionality reduction\n",
    "* Clustered users using **KMeans**\n",
    "* Visualized clusters and taste transitions\n",
    "\n",
    "4 Notebook 4: Dashboard & Reporting\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualized cluster distributions, taste shift timelines, and genre preferences\n",
    "* Merged user clusters back to rating data for insight analysis\n",

    "## Limitations\n",
    "\n",
    "* Movie genres are coarse-grained vs. music features like beats, lyrics, and energy\n",
    "* No user demographics (age, location, etc.) to refine personalization\n",
    "* Can’t directly map to Spotify-style emotional/tone tracking\n",

    "Yet, this still demonstrates:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ Taste drift modeling\n",
    "* ✅ Full ML pipeline from ingestion to dashboard\n",
    "* ✅ Real-world job readiness in behavioral modeling\n",
